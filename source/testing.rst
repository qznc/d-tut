Testing
=======

D provides a ``unittest`` keyword which enables you,
to put tests right next to functions.


.. literalinclude:: ../examplecode/unittestexample.d
   :language: d

Those code blocks are ignored by default.
If dmd gets the ``-unittest`` argument,
the tests are compiled and executed before ``main``.

   "Who needs unittests", I told myself, "when I'm
   obviously smart enough to write code once and have it work the first
   time?" But they just kept staring at me going "hey we're right here, use
   us!" until I was shamed into actually writing a few of them. And then I
   discovered that I *wasn't* the genius programmer I thought I was, and
   that my code was actually full of bugs, typos, and all sorts of other
   problems that only show up in corner cases that, of course, I'd failed
   to test by hand the first time round.

Another useful argument to dmd is ``-main``
for testing libraries.
It inserts an empty main function into the program,
which is necessary for execution
and runs the unittests before.

You should probably keep unittests out of templates,
otherwise they get instantiated multiple times,
which is probably not the intended behavior.

Coverage
--------

Another aspect of testing is the coverage
and dmd provides the ``-cov`` argument.
For the program above,
the following file is generated during unittesting:

.. code-block:: txt

       |/** @returns the argument times two */
      2|int twice(int x) { return x+x; }
       |
       |/** for example */
       |unittest {
      1|  assert (twice(-1) == -2);
      1|  assert (twice(2) == 4);
       |}
    examplecode/unittestexample.d is 100% covered

For continuous testing,
you can give ``-cov`` a parameter for a minimum coverage.

Advanced Unit Tests
-------------------

While D has builtin support for unit testing,
there is no support for advanced techniques like mockups,
setup, or teardown routines.
There are advance test frameworks available, though.
